# Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy-using-Python
Dynamic Pricing is an application of data science that involves adjusting the prices of a product or service based on various factors in real time. It is used by companies to optimize revenue by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, demographics, customer behaviour and competitor prices.


Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Overview
So, in a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.


To implement a data-driven dynamic pricing strategy, businesses typically require data that can provide insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other influencing factors. So to create a dynamic pricing strategy, we need to have a dataset based on:

historical sales data
customer purchase patterns
market demand forecasts
cost data
customer segmentation data, 
and real-time market data.
